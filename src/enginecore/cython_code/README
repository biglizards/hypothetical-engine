This is not quite the standard Cython set-up -- normally, each file would be compiled individually, with header files
for exporting functions. When statically including stateful libraries, however, that is not an option, as only the file
who created the OpenGL state (ie window.pyx) can see it, with other files segfaulting whenever they try to do anything.

To get around this, most files are textually included (a la c), which is _mostly_ fine, but has the usual quirks
around include order and more often than not the IDE can't auto-complete functions from seemingly disconnected files.
