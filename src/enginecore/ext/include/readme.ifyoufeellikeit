So these files aren't the original source, i've taken out the header files
(and also the licence where relevent, and sometimes also the source, although 
the source might be header only anyway). Not sure if that's a good idea, 
but something about just having a copy of the source on my repo doesn't sit 
well with me (even if i have the right to).

Also i slightly changed the nanogui header to supress warnings, but that change
isn't strictly neccerssary (ie you could replace it with the original file and
everything would still work).
