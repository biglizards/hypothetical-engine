from enginelib import camera

"""
The camera should:
 - produce the right matrix for a given set of values
 - react to changes in mouse position correctly
    - not jump when the mouse pos inits
    - moves in generally the right direction
 - in the case of the input camera, respond to input correctly 

Since they do that already I cant really be bothered to add tests.
I think it'd be a pain, since it involves a lot of vector stuff, and
I'd be just as likely to introduce a bug in the tests as in the code.
