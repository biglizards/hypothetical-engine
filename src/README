The code is split into 3 main sections:

enginecore, which is compiled and contains C and Cython code. It's mostly a collection of wrappers around libraries like
GLFW, NanoGUI, GLAD, and Assimp. If the engine were to be optimised, this is where the fast code would go.

enginelib is a pure python library that extends enginecore into a more user friendly interface, and adds most of the
interesting features, like
- a camera (technically, 4 cameras)
- saving and loading (including hot reloading)
- the entire editor
- entities
- scripts and the dispatch system

The example shows how a project could be structured, and contains a variety of example classes showing the flexibility
of the engine (such as the speaker and axis classes, and the scripts).
