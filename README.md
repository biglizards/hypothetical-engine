# hypothetical-engine

this is a work in progress

no documentation is provided since i'm not obligated to and why would anyone who's not me be running this mess

if you aren't me (or even if you are), feel free to ask me how it works, but if it's any later than 2019 i've probably forgotten by now

### known bugs
- camera is pretty jerky if you move slowly on mousepad, but fine with a mouse
- you need a static build of nanogui on windows (but not in linux?). 
  i have no idea why this happens.
- terry the cockroach (pretty cool dude)
- on my pc moving the mouse causes lag, but not when it's captured

notes:
 - good physics engine thing https://www.toptal.com/game/video-game-physics-part-i-an-introduction-to-rigid-body-dynamics
 - opengl click on thing hack http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/miscellaneous/clicking-on-objects/picking-with-an-opengl-hack/
