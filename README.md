# hypothetical-engine

This is (and likely will forever be) a work in progress.

Other than comments and examples, no documentation currently exists, but if you aren't me (or even if you are), feel free to ask me how it works.

### known bugs
- camera is pretty jerky if you move slowly on mousepad, but fine with a mouse
- you need a static build of nanogui on windows (but not in linux?). 
  i have no idea why this happens.
- terry the cockroach (pretty cool dude)
- on my pc moving the mouse causes lag, but not when it's captured
